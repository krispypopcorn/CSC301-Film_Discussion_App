## Summary

Initially, our team was going to build a movie review site. Based on the feedback from the TA, we
realized this would be quite similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, which is why we decided to make
something more original. This is how we decided to do a movie discussion site instead, which we
called "Conspire View". In this platform, users can create a discussion around a specific topic 
about a movie. For instance, they could discuss about a weird ending of a movie, or how a character
is suspicious and may have killed the protagonist, among other topics. This way, users can still
engage in the film community while interacting in a unique way through the site!

## Suggested starting view

It is suggested to start from the Login/index.html page and navigate from there.

NOTE: across the site there is only one movie page, for the movie "Avengers", and one discussion
page, for the topic "Iron Man is the coolest Avenger". All other movies and discussion topics 
simulate dummy data and will redirect the user/admin to the the only currently existing movie page 
and discussion page.
