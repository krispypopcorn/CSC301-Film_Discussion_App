## Summary

Initially, our team was going to build a movie review site. Based on the feedback from the TA, we realized this would be quite similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, which is why we decided to make something more original. This is how we decided to do a movie discussion site instead, which we called "Conspire View". In this platform, users can create a discussion around a specific topic about a movie. For instance, they could discuss about a weird ending of a movie, or how a character is suspicious and may have killed the protagonist, among other topics. This way, users can still engage in the film community while interacting in a unique way through the site!
