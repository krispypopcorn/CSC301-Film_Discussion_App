## Summary

Our web app is a movie discussion site, "Conspire View". The value of our platform is centered on allowing  users to discuss about movies. For instance, they could discuss about a weird ending of a movie, or how a characteris suspicious and may have killed the protagonist, what a great actor someone is, among other topics.

## Changes from phase 1
All features from phase 1 have been included in phase 2. We added a feature for new users to sign up through the login page.

## Suggested starting view

Local: http://localhost:8000/loginPage

## Overview of routes

We have a long list of routes in our Express server. For this reason, we created a directory with the different routes, which we have grouped into categories and which are explained below:


- main server (movie-server.js)
	These routes are used primarily used for login and logout.
	The rest of routes are imported into this module
- movie	
	These routes are used for retrieving or modifying movie information such as movie posts, ratings, trending movies, number of movies
- discussion
	These routes are used for retrieving or modifying discussion topic information such as discussion posts, their comments and likes
- user
	These routes are used for creating and deleting users as well for modifying their information (password, icon)
- page 
	These routes are used for retrieving the different pages while doing a security check to make sure that a user is logged in, otherwise the server will redirect them to the login page.
